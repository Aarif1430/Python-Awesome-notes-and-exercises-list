"""I am writing this module to help me upload repeated reminders to my
Tickler in Evernote.  I want to find the days of the month that follow
certain patterns for the next 30 or 31 days.

It will be slightly tricky to make sure I don't miss things that
should happen on the 31st or something.  I think my basic approach
will be to find the date one month from the day the script is run and
then subtract one day.  I also need to make sure that I run my main
Tickler reminder script on the correct day each month.  It will
probably be best to do this on the first, but I don't want to limit
this module by assuming reminders are always uploaded on the 1st.

This module will be used with approaches that use both email and
geeknote."""
